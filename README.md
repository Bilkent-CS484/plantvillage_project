# plantvillage_project

This project addresses the need for effective plant disease detection. The dataset covers 14 crops and 26 distinct diseases,
regarding the diversity and complexity of the agricultural challenges. Through computer vision techniques and deep learning
through 2 different architectures, we propose a solution for early diagnosis of crop diseases, highlighting the importance
of enhanced crop health and sustainable agriculture practices in our report.
